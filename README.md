# Welcome to Hangry Coona
A quick and dirt app for retrieving a random dish or filtering and scrolling through all stored dishes. 

App is made to order, with the following requirements:
 - should only consider screen size 320x568 (iPhone 5)
 - should have a function that displays a random dish from the provided data
 - should have a function to filter and horizontally scroll through all stored dishes from the provided data

Currently only built with the required size in mind, so best viewed on mobile devices.
